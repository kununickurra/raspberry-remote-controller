h1. Install the remote-controller web application on your raspberry.

This guide describes how to get started with your remote controller and deploy it on your raspberry.

h2. Prerequisites

h3. Web server setup

Install apache Tomcat (or any other web server) on your raspberry.

h3. Pi4j
* The raspberry controller uses the *pi4j* library to control the GPIOs. please check [http://pi4j.com/] for more info.
* Copy the library *pi4j-core-0.0.5* in the *tomcat/lib* directory. (Library can be downloaded here [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.pi4j/pi4j-core/0.0.5])
* (Re)Start Tomcat.

h3. Install SOAP service specification project.

SOAP service is build using a contract-first web service. Specification project is needed to be able to build the project.

Project can be downloaded here: [https://github.com/kununickurra/raspberry-remote-controller-soap-spec]

In the main directory, run a maven install
{code}
mvn clean install
{code}

h2. Install the remote controller project

Please make sure that you have configured your project before installing it [configuration]

In the main directory, run a maven install with the required profile
{code}
mvn clean install -P[profile selected]
{code}

h2. Deploy the web application in tomcat.

The artifact to deploy is *raspberry-ctrl.war* located in *raspberry-ctrl-webapp/target*

Simply deploy using the tomcat administration module.

h2. Simulation environment.

A simulation environment can be deployed on any web server can be created using the *simulator* maven profile.
This environment does not have any dependency on raspberry GPIO library so can be deployed anywhere and does NOT require a raspberry simulator.

{code}
mvn clean install -Psimulator
{code}

Hey,

This project will simply create a web application (war file) that can deployed on
a web server in a raspberry to drive hardware using the GPIO bus of the raspberry.

REST and SOAP services are deployed and can be accessed from anywhere.

Please go the the main directory and run the mvn:site site to deploy the Maven site.

Follow the menu on the upper right corner to get it up and running on your raspberry.

Enjoy.
Any question, comments or remarks, feel free!
